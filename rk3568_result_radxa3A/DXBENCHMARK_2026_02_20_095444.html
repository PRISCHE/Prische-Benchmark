                <p style="margin: 0; color: #495057; line-height: 1.6;">The time taken for the NPU Core to complete an inference operation. Lower values indicate faster processing on the NPU hardware.</p>

                <h4 style="margin: 0 0 8px 0; color: #0165B3; font-size: 1.1em;">Latency</h4>
                <p style="margin: 0; color: #495057; line-height: 1.6;">The total time from when the host CPU requests a task until it receives the result. This includes data transfer overhead and processing time. Lower values indicate better end-to-end performance.</p>

                <h4 style="margin: 0 0 8px 0; color: #6c757d; font-size: 1.1em;">SD (Standard Deviation)</h4>
                <p style="margin: 0; color: #495057; line-height: 1.6;">A measure of how spread out the data is from the mean. Lower values indicate more consistent and stable performance across multiple runs.</p>

                <h4 style="margin: 0 0 8px 0; color: #6c757d; font-size: 1.1em;">CV (Coefficient of Variation)</h4>
                <p style="margin: 0; color: #495057; line-height: 1.6;">A normalized measure of variability, calculated as Standard Deviation divided by Mean (SD/Mean). This metric enables comparison of data dispersion between groups with different averages. Lower values indicate more stable and predictable performance.</p>
